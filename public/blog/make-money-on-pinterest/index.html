<p>How can you make money on Pinterest? Well, it’s simple. Pinterest is nothing like most social media networks. This platform encourages you to grow your social media presence. In other words, most social media networks restrict publishers from sharing affiliate links or promoting affiliate programs. Whereas, Pinterest encourages <a href="/blog/social-media-monetization">social media monetization</a>. Lets get to it, how to <em>make money on Pinterest</em>, in six steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-build-a-landing-page">1. Build a Landing Page</h3>
<p>First, you need to create a landing page. What is a landing page? When it comes to internet marketing, a landing page (destination page, lead capture page, squeeze page) is a signal web page used for marketing or promoting a product, service, or message. The landing page provides you with a platform to send targeted leads, prospects, and customers. It’s called a landing page because it’s where the visitor lands. There are two types of landing pages, a reference landing page, and a transactional landing page.</p>
<p>Reference landing page – a reference landing page displays information that’s essential to the customer. This page consists of text, images, and links. The purpose of the reference landing page is to lead customers to the transactional page.</p>
<p>Transactional landing page – the transactional landing page contains information that influences customers to take action.</p>
<p>Option #1 (Purchase a landing page) In my opinion purchasing a landing page is the best option simply because you have more control over your content. You can tweak the theme, customize the background, edit code, and much more. Whereas, you have no control over a free landing page. All in all, you have a better chance to influence consumers when you purchase a site. If you are on a limited budget, I suggest purchasing a site through Bluehost.</p>
<p>Option #2 (Get a free landing page) If you don’t want to pay for a landing page. You can create a free landing page on <a href="https://linktr.ee">Linktree</a> Linktree is a freemium social media landing page.
